# CFA-Zengarden
<br>During class we were set the Zengarden challenge, which is to restyle the HTML porvided on the Zengarden website. We could only use CSS and were not allowed to edit the HTML. </br>
I went for a "learning" theme that involved making the page look child friendly. At the begining I did the whole challenge with just CSS but towards the end I did add a few features that altered the HTML such as the moving banner and vector heart.
